# Contract (after deployment)
NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="deployed_contract_address"
TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="deployed_token_address"
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/developla/softcore.git
cd softcore

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Configure Network

   ```bash
   # Deploy to Core DAO testnet
   npm run deploy-contract -- --network testnet

   # Or deploy to Core DAO mainnet
   npm run deploy-contract -- --network core
   ```

2. Verify Contract

   ```bash
   # Verify on Core DAO Explorer
   npm run verify-contract -- <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --network core
   ```

3. Update Environment Variables
   - Update `NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `.env`

# Softcore NFT System Setup

This guide explains how to set up and deploy the Softcore NFT system.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- npm or yarn installed
- A wallet with some test CORE tokens (for testnet deployment)

## Setup Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create or modify `.env.local` with:

   ```env
   CORE_RPC_URL="https://rpc.coredao.org"
   CORE_TESTNET_RPC_URL="https://rpc.test.btcs.network"
   CORE_EXPLORER_API_KEY="your_explorer_api_key"
   PRIVATE_KEY="your_actual_private_key_here"
   NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="will_be_generated_after_deployment"
   ```

3. **Compile Smart Contract**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. **Deploy to Testnet**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet
   ```

   This will create a `deployment.json` file with your contract address.

5. **Update Environment Variables**
   Copy the deployed contract address from `deployment.json` to your `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="your_deployed_contract_address"
   ```

## Contract Details

The NFT contract (`SoftcoreNFT.sol`) includes:

- ERC721 standard implementation
- URI storage for metadata
- Minting functionality (owner only)
- Burning capability

## API Endpoints

### Mint NFT

- **Endpoint**: `/api/nft/mint`
- **Method**: POST
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "userAddress": "0x...",
    "tokenUri": "ipfs://..."
  }
  ```

## Testing

1. **Local Testing**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

2. **Testnet Deployment**
   - Ensure you have test CORE tokens
   - Deploy to testnet using the command in step 4
   - Verify the contract on Core testnet explorer

## Troubleshooting

- **Transaction Fails**: Check if you have enough CORE for gas
- **Contract Not Found**: Verify NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS is set correctly
- **Minting Fails**: Ensure you're calling from the owner address

## Network Information

- **Core Mainnet RPC**: https://rpc.coredao.org
- **Core Testnet RPC**: https://rpc.test.btcs.network
- **Chain IDs**:
  - Mainnet: 1116
  - Testnet: 1115

## Security Notes

- Never commit your private key or sensitive API keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment
