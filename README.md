## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/developla/softcore-games.git
cd softcore-games
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a secret.json file in the root directory:

```json
{
  "PrivateKey": "your-private-key-here"
}
```

4. Set up environment variables:

```bash

DATABASE_URL=your_mongodb_url
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_TESTNET=your_nft_contract_address_testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_MAINNET=your_nft_contract_address_mainnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_random_api_key
```

5. Deploy the SoftCoreNFT Smart Contract:

First, compile the contract:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Then deploy to Core DAO testnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network core_testnet
```

Or deploy to Core DAO mainnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network coredao
```

Save the deployed contract address that appears in the console output.

6. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start your journey.

## üìù Smart Contract Details

### SoftCoreNFT Contract

The SoftCoreNFT contract is an ERC721 implementation that allows:

- Minting of special moments as NFTs
- Storage of metadata URIs for each token
- Transfer and management of NFT ownership

Key contract features:

```solidity
// Mint new NFTs (only contract owner)
function safeMint(address to, string memory uri) public onlyOwner

// Get token URI
function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (string memory)
```

### Deployment Configuration

The contract can be deployed to:

- Core DAO Testnet

  - RPC URL: https://rpc.test2.btcs.network
  - Chain ID: 1114
  - Explorer: https://scan.test2.btcs.network

- Core DAO Mainnet
  - RPC URL: https://rpc.coredao.org
  - Chain ID: 1116
  - Explorer: https://scan.coredao.org

### Contract Verification

After deployment, verify your contract on Core DAO Explorer:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network core_testnet <DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### API Routes

#### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new user account
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/verify` - Verify JWT token

#### Game

- `POST /api/generate-scene` - Generate new game scene
- `POST /api/generate-characters` - Generate character data
- `POST /api/mint-nft` - Mint scene as NFT

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**:

   - User submits username, email, and password
   - Password is hashed using bcryptjs
   - User data is stored in MongoDB
   - JWT token is generated and returned

2. **Login**:

   - User provides username and password
   - Credentials are verified against database
   - JWT token is generated and returned

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - JWT token is verified using middleware
   - Invalid or expired tokens redirect to login
   - Token is automatically refreshed when needed

### Game State Management

- Game state is persisted in localStorage
- JWT token handles authentication state
- React Query manages API state and caching
- Automatic token verification on protected routes

## üåê Core DAO Integration

SoftCORE Games leverages Core DAO's blockchain infrastructure for:

- NFT minting of special moments
- Secure wallet connections
- Transaction processing

## üîê Security Considerations

When deploying and interacting with the smart contract:

1. Never commit your private keys or secret.json to version control
2. Use a dedicated development wallet for testing
3. Always test on testnet before mainnet deployment
4. Verify contract source code on the blockchain explorer
5. Audit contract code before mainnet deployment
